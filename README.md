Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up with their name, email, and password. After successful registration, their data is stored in localStorage. Users can also log in using their credentials, and a session is created using sessionStorage.

Language Selection: Upon successful login, users are prompted to choose a language. The available languages are displayed, and users can select their preferred language.

Job Listings: Once a language is selected, the application displays job listings related to that language. Each job listing includes a "View Description" button that allows users to see more details about the job.

Job Description & Application: Clicking on the "View Description" button takes users to a new page displaying the job description. Users can also apply for the job by clicking the "Apply" button.

Job Application Form: When the "Apply" button is clicked, a job application form is displayed. Users can fill in their name, email, upload a cover letter, and preview their application before submitting it.

Application Submission: After previewing their application, users can click the "Submit" button to apply for the job. A success message is displayed to confirm that the application has been submitted successfully.
